- 👋 Hi, I’m @AustinTeddyCodes
- 👀 I’m interested in Mathematics! Although I am still fairly new to the field, I am currently especially interested in Differential Geometry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning applied combinatorics, foundations of proofs, multivariable calculus, and object-oriented programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to creating algorithms and data structures primarily as a source of learning.
- 📫 You can email me at barton.austin.t@gmail.com or search me through LinkedIn!
